This was my Third-Year Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering Mini Project.

I made it with [Debayan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/debayan-mazumdar-1a8a5821a/?originalSubdomain=in), a good friend of mine.

Unfortunately, most of the code we wrote is now lost somewhere deep within the labyrinth of computers in the Microcontrollers Lab at PICT.

These are all the files I could gather from the computer I have and the one at the lab.

You can see the device at work on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vahrcpdgLIg&list=PLoDygGHJ35GHnISrrwo50JsnQ6fwZTDqs&index=7) (WARNING: Bad Audio!).
