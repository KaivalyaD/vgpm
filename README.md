This was my Third-Year Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering Mini-Project.

A X-Y Plotter running on a single 8051 microcontroller, with all hardware and software designed and implemented from the scratch! Thanks to my college (PICT), we could 3D-print a lot of mechanical parts.

I made it with [Debayan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/debayan-mazumdar-1a8a5821a/?originalSubdomain=in), a good friend of mine.

Debayan did most of the hardware and I wrote most of the code.

Unfortunately, most of the code we wrote is now lost somewhere deep within the labyrinth of computers in the Embedded Systems Lab at PICT.

These are all the files I could gather from the computer I have and the one at the lab.

You can see the device at work on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vahrcpdgLIg&list=PLoDygGHJ35GHnISrrwo50JsnQ6fwZTDqs&index=7) (WARNING: Bad Audio!).
